# Development Background {nekochan}`kossori`

The author [@takanory](https://twitter.com/takanory) liked Nekochan emojis introduced in our company's Slack.
I was a heavy user of emojis and also installed and poromoted Nekochan emojis in related community Slacks {nekochan}`ouen-nya;2em`

One day on Shikamatsu-san's X (Twitter), I saw an example of using Nekochan emojis in presentation slide {nekochan}`miru-nya;2em`.

"I see... I didn't know that was possible!" I immediately thought of copying the idea.
But I thought it would be a bit tedious to copy Nekochan emoji images on each slides {nekochan}`mu-nya;2em`.

I use the Sphinx extension, [sphinx-revealjs](https://sphinx-revealjs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to create slides (my slides -> [slides.takanory.net ](https://slides.takanory.net/)).
And I use [Sphinx Design](https://sphinx-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/badges_buttons.html#fontawesome-icons) extension to display [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons in my slides.

In the same way, I thought it would be possible to display Nekochan emojis on slides with a simple string (in this case the `nekochan` roll and emoji name), so I tried to create my first Sphinx extension {nekochan}`kitaeru;2em`.

I would be happy if sphinx-nekochan could be used to create documents and slides with Nekochan emojis all over Japan and the world {nekochan}`kitai;2em`!!
